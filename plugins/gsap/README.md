# GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

#### Professional-grade animation for the modern web

GSAP is a JavaScript library for building high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. Animate CSS, SVG, canvas, React, Vue, WebGL, colors, strings, motion paths, generic objects...anything JavaScript can touch! No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, and tight control while solving real-world problems on millions of sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations **just work**.  At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It's up to 20x faster than jQuery! See the <a href="https://greensock.com/why-gsap/">"Why GSAP?" article</a> for what makes GSAP so special.

GSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. **Zero dependencies.**

There are many optional <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap-plugins/">plugins</a> and <a href="https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer/">easing</a> functions for achieving advanced effects easily like morphing, scrolling, or animating along a motion path.

Click the green "Get GSAP Now" button at <a href="https://greensock.com/?download=GSAP-JS">greensock.com</a> for more options and installation instructions, including CDN URLs for various plugins. 

**Every major ad network excludes GSAP from file size calculations** and most have it on their own CDNs as well, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s). 

### NPM
See the <a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#npm">guide to using GSAP via NPM here</a>.

```javascript
npm install gsap
```
The default (main) file is gsap.js which includes most of the eases as well as the core plugins like CSSPlugin, AttrPlugin, SnapPlugin, ModifiersPlugin, and all of the utility methods like interpolate(), mapRange(), etc. 
```javascript
// typical import
import gsap from "gsap";

// or get other plugins:
import Draggable from "gsap/Draggable";
import ScrollToPlugin from "gsap/ScrollToPlugin";

// or all tools are exported from the "all" file (excluding bonus plugins):
import { gsap, ScrollToPlugin, Draggable, MotionPathPlugin } from "gsap/all";

// don't forget to register plugins
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollToPlugin, Draggable, MotionPathPlugin); 
```
The NPM files are ES modules, but there's also a /dist/ directory with UMD files for extra compatibility.
